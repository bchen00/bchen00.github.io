	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
		I am currently an undergraduate at University of Pennsylvania studying Physics and Computer Science (expected B.A. and M.S. in Spring 2022). 
		I have conducted my undergraduate research in cryo-electron tomography advised by <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9162152">Prof. Yi-Wei Chang</a> (<a href="https://www.yiweichanglab.org/">lab website</a>). 
		The focus of my research has been on developing novel computational systems and chemical imaging methods for cryogenic electron tomography.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In Fall 2022, I will begin a PhD in Electrical Engineering at Caltech where I will be advised by <a href="https://ee.caltech.edu/people/mohmir">Prof. Mohammad Mirhosseini</a> (<a href="https://qubit.caltech.edu/">lab website</a>).
		I will be developing chip-scale quantum devices with applications to quantum computing and communication.
