	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
		I am an Electrical Engineering PhD student at Caltech where I am advised by <a href="https://ee.caltech.edu/people/mohmir">Prof. Mohammad Mirhosseini</a> (<a href="https://qubit.caltech.edu/">lab website</a>).
		My research is on developing on-chip microwave-optical quantum transducers, with the ultimate goal of enabling distributed quantum computers and long-distance quantum networks. My skill set spans the full-stack of quantum hardware R&D, including device conceptualization, design, fabrication, packaging, and measurement. I am supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.     
	</p>
	<br>	
	<p>
		I obtained a B.A. in Physics and Computer Science and M.S. in Physics from University of Pennsylvania in Spring 2022. My undergraduate research was in cryo-electron tomography advised by <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9162152">Prof. Yi-Wei Chang</a> (<a href="https://www.yiweichanglab.org/">lab website</a>). 
		The focus of my research was on developing novel computational systems and chemical imaging methods for cryo-electron tomography.
